## EasyMeal Account Deletion Website

This is a website that I have developed for EasyMeal users to delete their account an any data associated with their account. The icons used on this website were obtained from [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You can also view the deployed website [here](https://www.nolancn.com/).

If you notice any bugs or issues with my code, I would appreciate it if you took the time to notify me! I am a junior developer, so I will appreciate any insights on how to improve my code.

### KNOWN PROBLEMS:

- Improve user data deletion (currently done client-side)
- Fix issues with reading Firebase configuration variables from environment variables
- Prevent website reload after sending password reset email
